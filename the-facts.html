    <h2 class="facts-heading">History of Plastic</h2>
    <hr class="block-divider">
    <p class="facts-content ml-2">Plastic wasn’t invented until the late 19th century, 
    they were essential for the war effort and women had to give up nylon stockings, 
    a revolutionary material that had swept the nation. 
    And nylon wasn’t the only plastic essential to the war effort, plexiglass, 
    cellophane and polyethylene were all vital particularly in aircraft.</p>
    <p class="facts-content ml-2">But public production didn’t explode until the 1950s. 
    In the US, in particular, plastic became a revolutionary material and Americans began to celebrate what became known as 
    “Throwaway Living”. Disposable plastics allowed for the fast food industry to appear and flourish, with no washing up 
    needed McDonalds started the craze that would sweep the nation and the world until the modern day. 
    Fast food restaurants have only just begun to move away from single-use plastics in the last five years. </p>
    <p class="facts-content ml-2">The appeal of less work for the individual allowed corporations reliance on these single-use 
    plastics to grow and production of them to increase. 
    As the material designed to be thrown away became so important to life the waste it produced was quickly 
    becoming a problem. </p>
    <p class="facts-content ml-2">For years waste filled landfills, and litter made its way to the ocean and people are finally 
    starting to take notice of this as a problem. And action is starting to be taken, corporations are moving away from 
    single-use plastics and recycling where they can. 
    Everyone is starting to treat recycling as second nature, but we are far from finished. </p>

    <h2 class="facts-heading">Dangers of Microplastics</h2>
    <hr class="block-divider">
    <p class="facts-content ml-2">Unlike climate change the presence of plastic in our oceans cannot be denied, 
    but it is not what we can see that is doing the most damage. 
    Plastics which are less than 5 millimetres in length known as microplastics are the new issue facing our planet, 
    and they are more hazardous than you might think.</p>
    <p class="facts-content ml-2">These plastics are unfortunately not special and don’t always come from smaller plastics. 
    Larger plastics take a very long time to biodegrade but whilst in the ocean, 
    a combination of the sun’s rays and thrashing waves break the plastic down to lots of tiny microplastics.</p>
    <p class="facts-content ml-2">Unlike other plastics the danger microplastics pose is not from animals consuming them or becoming
     entangled in them. Although they can build up within animals digestive tracts and cause similar issues for them, the issue 
     scientists are more concerned about is that of chemicals.</p>
    <p class="facts-content ml-2">The miniature plastics can absorb and give off harmful chemicals that do incredible damage to marine life. 
    There are even fears that the chemicals could effect higher up the food chain and into our own diets.</p>
    <p class="facts-content ml-2">Although microplastics are an emerging field of study and it’s impacts are not fully understood 
    we are helping to fund science looking into this emerging issue. If you want to find out more click the link below:</p>
