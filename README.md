# Living Ocean Trust Charity Website
This website has been created to promote the ideology of the Living Ocean Trust and to show clearly what they are doing and how the user can help. The oceans are currently
facing an ecological disaster the likes of which have never before been seen. Plastic, which was once praised as a miracle product is now polluting our waters, poisoning them
and large numbers of marine life. Unless we act soon we will no long have a 'Living Ocean'.

### Website Purpose:
* Create awareness of the issues currently facing the ocean
* Make it clear what the Living Ocean Trust are doing and how the user can get involved
* Make donating available on the website, and make it clear how to donate
